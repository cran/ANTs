#' @title Double permutation approach for gambit of the group
#' @param obs a data frame of gambit of the group observations. The data frame must have a column named 'ID'.
#' @param scan  an integer indicating the column of scans of individual associations in obs.
#' @param ctrlf A confounding factor by which to control group associationsin obs.
#' @param nperm number of permutations to perform.
#' @param progress a boolean indicating if the permutation process must be visible.
#' @param index Which type of index of associations to calculate:
#' \itemize{
#' \item 'sri' for Simple ratio index: \eqn{x \div x+yAB+yA+yB}
#' \item 'hw' for Half-weight index: \eqn{x/x+yAB+1/2(yA+yB)}
#' \item 'sr' for Square root index:\eqn{x/sqr((x+yAB+yA)(x+yAB+yB))}
#' }
#' @param measure a character indicating the social network measure to compute (Only those available in ANTs)
#' @param test a character indicating the test to realize to account for the social network measure
#' @param df a data frame of individual characteristics in which store permutations.
#' @param dfid an integer or a string indicating the column with individual ids in argument \emph{df}.
#' @param ... Additional arguments related to the social network measure to compute (argument measure).
#' @details Output need to be incorporated in a data frame and node label permutations with ANTs function perm.net.nl need to be performed before using any ANTs functions "stat.".
#' @return A numeric vector of individuals social measure corrected by double permutation approch (node label permutation can the be perfomed on this output)
